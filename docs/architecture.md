# Agentic SDLC Architecture

This document describes the implemented process from an `agentic-SDLC` issue
through baseline and dependency preflight, research, human plan approval, task execution, security, testing,
independent review, and final PR publication. The controller makes lifecycle
decisions deterministically; agents propose plans, code, and assessments.

The scope is one control repository, Node.js/TypeScript, and sequential coding
tasks. The control repository can also serve registered target repositories: it
authenticates their intake receipts, runs workers against their source, and
publishes their PRs (see [Cross-Repository Intake](#cross-repository-intake)).
The diagrams describe implementation behavior, not proof of a successful
live deployment. See [operations.md](operations.md) for activation, credentials,
branch protection, and the first live pilot.

## Diagram Guide

- [Application Architecture](#application-architecture): services and trust zones.
- [Detailed Process Flow](#detailed-process-flow): the complete feature lifecycle.
- [Approval Conversation](#approval-conversation): requester decisions and revisions.
- [Worker Handoff](#worker-handoff): dispatch, artifacts, and result acceptance.
- [Security and Testing](#security-and-testing): deterministic gate execution.
- [Recovery Flow](#recovery-flow): pauses, repairs, retries, and cancellation.
- [Component Relationships](#component-relationships): implementation ownership.
- [State and Evidence](#state-and-evidence): durable records and publication rules.
- [Cross-Repository Intake](#cross-repository-intake): receipts, source handoff, and publication for registered targets.

Solid arrows show control or data flow. Dotted arrows show credentials or
supporting context. A gate's outgoing edge labels state the decision; agents
cannot choose an unauthorized transition merely by requesting it.

## Application Architecture

Everything runs through GitHub Actions and GitHub APIs. There is no locally
hosted controller, separate webhook receiver, database server, or message broker.

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control | Node.js | 24.8+ | Run the controller and validators |
| Source | TypeScript | Pinned | Model state and API contracts |
| Agents | gh-aw and Copilot | gh-aw v0.88.7 | Compile and run role workers |
| API | Octokit | Pinned | Access GitHub REST APIs |
| Contracts | Zod | Pinned | Validate state and worker reports |
| Evidence | Actions artifacts | Managed | Transfer reports between runs |
| Security | CodeQL, npm audit, Gitleaks | Pinned where applicable | Scan code |
| Testing | Node test runner and c8 | Pinned where applicable | Test and cover |

State and source changes are stored in separate Git branches. GitHub Issues
provides the human interface, while Actions artifacts carry worker output.
Copilot inference, npm advisories, and allowlisted documentation are external
dependencies; unavailable services do not automatically waive a gate.

### Key Decisions

- **Separate reasoning from authority.** Workers have read-only repository
  access. Only the controller receives the App token used for publishing.
- **Keep state outside the conversation.** Versioned JSON is authoritative;
  comments are commands, proposed-plan displays, or progress projections.
- **Publish the feature PR last.** Intermediate work lives on a feature branch.
  A separate baseline-maintenance draft requires an explicit maintainer command;
  neither PR is approved or merged by an agent.

The hosted agent runtime uses sandbox containers. Local development and
documentation rendering do not require Docker. Deterministic check jobs are
separate Actions jobs, not additional Copilot agents.

## Detailed Process Flow

The labels `researching`, `awaiting_approval`, and so on are persisted lifecycle
phases. Transitions below assume the worker result has passed the acceptance
checks described in [Worker Handoff](#worker-handoff).

The [Research profile](../.github/agents/research.agent.md) requires a Technology
and Architecture Decision in proposed plans. It separates the application's
baseline from controller tooling, compares product-fit options, recommends
components and data flow, and independently assesses pipeline support and
maintainer prerequisites. Unsupported implementation or validation requires a
structured blocker with actionable diagnostics and remedies rather than an
executable plan with unapproved prerequisites. Optional structured plan policy
binds requirement IDs, task-splitting permission, dependency pins and exact
vendor-patch permissions into the plan hash. These fields constrain authority,
not the truth of model reasoning. Human review and deterministic validation
remain necessary. The pipeline still targets Node.js/TypeScript.

Important details behind the diagram:

1. A lifecycle is created once per issue. Relabeling or reopening does not
   restart a permanently cancelled lifecycle.
2. Task selection uses the first incomplete, unblocked task whose dependencies
  are all implemented. Approved execution steps preserve its original criteria.
  There is one registered active job per lifecycle, even when multiple tasks
  are independent. After an amendment, retaining every completed task skips
  coding and proceeds directly to scanning; it does not reuse old gate evidence.
3. The controller records a testing-stage result on the commit containing the
   accepted tests. It then reruns scanning and security, preserving that new
   test-preparation evidence so testing does not loop indefinitely.
4. Any subsequent code change clears earlier evidence. Repair feedback also
   clears evidence, even when a repair later produces no file changes.
5. An accepted delegated decision clears gate evidence and retries its
    requesting stage. After each gate result, the controller selects the
    earliest required gate without current-commit evidence. If a Review retry
    precedes missing gates, its evidence is discarded and Review runs again last.
6. Tasks marked implemented in state remain open as GitHub issues until merge.
   The final PR contains `Closes #<epic-number>`; GitHub handles epic closure
   on merge to its default branch, and reconciliation closes child tasks.
7. Invalid output, missing artifacts, pauses, and scope drift follow the
   separate [Recovery Flow](#recovery-flow), not an unconditional success edge.
   `ProcContinue` returns to the registered phase, not necessarily coding:
   incomplete Security resumes Security, Testing resumes Testing, and so on.
   Approved splits resume the next registered coding step. Proposal nodes may
   wait for authority; a task-local wait can leave unrelated ready tasks running.
8. Pending cost reconciliation is independent of these phases. It may continue
   after cancellation or merge but never authorizes a worker result or new work.

## Approval Conversation

Approval is an issue-comment protocol, not a model-generated decision and not
a runner waiting for keyboard input. Each event starts a short controller run.
For a registered target, the comments are on the target issue and are read on
the 10-minute poll instead, because target events do not reach this repository.

```

Only new, unedited human comments with standalone recognized commands are
processed, once per comment ID. The requester may approve or revise after
trusted intake, even if they are not a repository writer. Writers may also
approve. Among processed commands, those from other human authors receive an
explicit rejection without authorizing a lifecycle change. Authorized authors
also receive rejection feedback for invalid state, insufficient privileges for
the command, or stale versions.

A first lifecycle can only be created from an authorized human label event, not
from a later schedule or manual reconciliation. If the issue changes after that
event, the event snapshot remains authoritative and execution blocks before a
worker is dispatched. A revision snapshots the current issue and default branch, invalidates the
active job, clears approval and evidence, retires existing tasks as not planned,
and chooses a new versioned feature branch. Older branches and unsettled cost
identities are retained; accounting uses their original commit and plan bindings.
An edited issue requires a full revision, or a scoped amendment when a plan is
already approved, before execution can continue. The same choices apply to
protected-path default-branch movement. A trusted-baseline amendment needs a
maintainer and retains source rather than restarting it. Before the first plan
approval, use `/sdlc revise` after a baseline repair; `/sdlc amend` is rejected.
Movement outside protected paths is adopted between jobs instead of blocking,
without updating the baseline or rebasing the feature. `/sdlc retry` does not
authorize changed scope. A default-branch rename requires a full revision.

## Worker Handoff

Both agent and deterministic workers use the same durable job protocol. A
completion event is only a reconciliation hint, not sufficient proof that the
result belongs to the lifecycle.

The adapter selects the expected worker file from the registered stage:

- `research`, `decompose`, `code`, `security`, `test`, `document`, `review`, and `maintain`
  use the [compiled agent workflow](../.github/workflows/sdlc-agent.lock.yml).
- `scan`, `validate`, and `integrate` use the
  [deterministic check workflow](../.github/workflows/sdlc-checks.yml).

All eight agent stages select the inference model at workflow runtime from the
repository variable `SDLC_MODEL`, falling back to `auto` when it is unset or
empty. The model choice does not change worker permissions or result acceptance.
The configured selector is distinct from concrete model IDs reported by runtime
token-usage telemetry. Available observations are informational cost metadata;
`auto` is never treated as a resolved identity and need not select the same model
for every stage or inference.

The credential-free `budget` job validates `SDLC_AIC_CREDIT_LIMIT` after
activation, defaulting to `250` when unset or empty. It accepts decimal integers
from 1 to 10,000. Its output is passed to both inference jobs through
`engine.env.GH_AW_MAX_AI_CREDITS` and to the worker's runtime policy. The
primary agent and threat detector enforce the same configured cap separately;
their combined usage is not bounded by a single shared counter. Invalid
configuration prevents either inference job from starting.

Acceptance requires the controller App as the run actor, the registered trusted
workflow commit, the expected job name and workflow, and `run_attempt == 1`.
The report supplies `jobId` and `inputSha`; stage, task, and plan authority come
from the registered job, not arbitrary fields supplied by an agent.

The controller accepts one unexpired `sdlc-result` artifact, with bounded
compressed and result-file sizes. It parses `result.json` as data and never
executes downloaded code. Agent proposals remain untrusted even when their
workflow provenance matches.

The separate `sdlc-cost` artifact is written by a workflow post-step rather than
by the agent, so it records what the run actually consumed rather than what the
agent claims. Deterministic check runs upload no such artifact and are charged
runner time only.

For deterministic checks, the dedicated `SDLC Check Result` job must succeed.
That job can report a failed scanner or test even when the overall workflow
conclusion is `failure`. A failed agent workflow has no equivalent exception.

The [Coding profile](../.github/agents/code.agent.md) requires acceptance-to-check
mapping, current diagnostic triage, consumer entry-point checks, and explicit
verification limits. It instructs the agent to write and collect provisional
`blocked` progress reports. Trusted preparation seeds coding and Security reports.
Validated structured incomplete-work drafts can seed a bounded successor at the
same exact job context, including split step and execution breakdown. They are
never automatically published or accepted as evidence. A successful successor
must revalidate them. See [Coding and Repair Evidence](operations.md#coding-and-repair-evidence).

## Security and Testing

Security uses ordinary tools in addition to agent reasoning. Coverage is
measured by executing tests, not by accepting a model's estimated percentage.

`scan` requires `prepare`, `codeql`, and `security`. `validate` requires
`prepare` and `tests`. `integrate` requires `prepare`, `integration`, and a valid
tree-hash receipt; unrelated jobs are intentionally not required.
If preparation fails, the result job cannot produce an accepted report.
For a registered target, every stage also requires `source`. A target's
`integrate` tree hash comes only from `source`, which holds the read access
needed to compare target trees; the `integration` job does not run, and its
output cannot vouch for a target.

Preflight is a registered `scan` with a separate purpose and probe SHA, not a
final candidate gate. Baseline scans precede research; declared dependency bytes
are checked before implementation. Alternatives are bounded and explicit patch
permissions require human approval before any vendor-only repair. The repaired
installed bytes must pass preflight before feature tasks proceed. Ordinary
`CI / CodeQL` applies the same findings policy to PRs and default-branch pushes.

The current checks include:

- **CodeQL:** JavaScript/TypeScript, `security-extended` queries, and build mode
  `none`. SARIF is evaluated locally and retained as an artifact, not uploaded
  against the workflow's unrelated default-branch commit.
- **Dependencies:** npm audits the candidate lockfile and blocks high or
  critical vulnerabilities. Failed or malformed audit output cannot pass.
- **Secrets:** Gitleaks v8.30.1 uses a checksum-pinned binary and trusted
  configuration. Findings block the gate; source-controlled ignore files and
  inline allow comments cannot suppress them in this workflow.
- **Tests:** baseline and candidate dependencies are installed without npm
  lifecycle scripts. A trusted runner invokes TypeScript and Node tests with
  c8, using test and source patterns from policy.
- **Coverage:** at least 80% lines and 70% branches, with no permitted drop from
  the baseline. Missing tests or invalid coverage data fail validation.

On SARIF validation failure, the validator emits JSON-encoded diagnostics through
a job output. Blocking findings include at most ten rule IDs, source locations,
and severities, with bounded metadata fields and no source snippets. The result
job carries at most 6000 characters into repair feedback, labeled as untrusted
scanner data, only when CodeQL did not succeed. Missing, malformed, or oversized
diagnostics fall back to the failed job names and run link; they cannot turn a
failed check into a pass. The full SARIF remains in the `sdlc-codeql` artifact.
Registered job, approved plan, trusted revision, and source-commit checks remain
unchanged.

The security and final review agents assess the complete integrated diff and
available evidence. They are advisory assessments with limited tool access,
not proof that a feature is free of defects. Native GitHub rules and human
review remain necessary at the PR boundary.

The [Testing profile](../.github/agents/test.agent.md) first derives a risk-based
coverage map from approved behavior and public contracts, with independently
justified expected results. Missing test details may be filled in; undefined
product rules require clarification. Reports distinguish tested behavior,
demonstrated defects, unavailable tooling, and unfinished or approved later human
checks. Production defects return `changes_requested` with a reproduction in
the summary because that path does not apply proposed test changes. Ambiguity
or incomplete required testing returns `blocked`. The existing `pass` path
still leads to independent scans and deterministic validation as shown above.
These are prompt-level completeness rules, not new schema-enforced fields or
browser-validation capabilities. Test-only scope and baseline immutability at
`state.baseSha` are unchanged.

The Security profile requires explicit coverage, findings, outstanding checks,
and a handoff. It prioritizes high-risk paths without silently dropping other
applicable review areas. Trusted preparation seeds a provisional `blocked`
result after checking the registered job; the agent refreshes it through the
normal collect command as work progresses. The final post-step attempts to
upload the last packaged result even if inference fails. This is best-effort
capture, not continuous remote storage; abrupt runner termination can lose it.
Checkpoints from failed workflows are untrusted continuation inputs, never
Security evidence. A successful workflow returning a structured `incomplete_work`
blocker can continue within budget. Legacy `blocked` reports still stop normally.
Neither path is a schema-level proof of review completeness.

## Recovery Flow

The controller records state before dispatching work or invalidating a job.
Only recognized, current results can advance a running lifecycle.

State validation and any required migration must succeed before this phase-based
recovery flow runs. A schema error or failed migration write stops reconciliation
for that issue without changing its lifecycle phase.

### Recovery Rules

- **Duplicate events:** reuse the issue lifecycle and active job. Commands are
  deduplicated by comment ID; repeated side effects reuse controller-owned
  markers or existing linked resources.
- **Lost dispatch:** wait up to 10 minutes for a matching run, then allow one
  additional dispatch of the same job identity. Exhaustion counts as an
  infrastructure failure; a replacement job receives a new identity.
- **Timeout:** after 90 minutes from job creation, reconciliation cancels an
  unfinished run and counts a failure. Agent and check jobs have their own
  shorter Actions time limits.
- **Infrastructure failures:** two consecutive failures block the lifecycle.
  Successful results reset this counter. A missing or malformed scanner report
  is not a clean scan.
- **Artifact retrieval:** transient `404`, `408`, `429`, rate-limited `403`, and
  `5xx` responses, plus an empty result-artifact listing, retain the completed
  registered job for retry until its job timeout. Persistent retrieval failure
  then consumes one infrastructure failure.
- **Active-job cost retrieval:** thrown transient errors retain the current job until the
  same timeout. Malformed receipts, non-retryable download errors, or transient
  errors past that deadline consume one worker failure without reading or
  accepting the result. Known totals are preserved, cost history is marked
  incomplete, and the issue status identifies the error and run. The existing
  consecutive-failure budget bounds replacement attempts before blocking.
- **Deferred costs:** interrupted jobs and incomplete receipts retain a compact
  original job identity outside active-job authority. Discovery and cost reads
  continue in every phase, with cancellation retried for abandoned running
  jobs. A fixed window of `jobTimeoutMinutes` starts at first deferral and is
  never extended by retries or replanning. Complete observations are settled
  once. A permanent retrieval error or still-missing data after the deadline
  records only known values, marks incomplete history, and stops collection.
  These accounting failures do not consume the current worker's failure budget.
- **Legacy repair findings:** accepted unstructured `changes_requested` after decomposition return
  to coding, with two automatic repair rounds. The same outcome from research
  or decomposition counts as a failed stage instead.
- **Structured recovery:** verified categories route separately. Automatic retries,
  repairs, continuations and splits are bounded by fingerprint, stage, task/step,
  global jobs and repairs. Identical deterministic repairs stop without another
  inference. Task-local blockers permit unrelated ready tasks; repository trust
  failures do not. Retry and continuation resume the original registered stage;
  only coding repairs and approved coding steps route to coding. Invalid recovery
  payloads consume bounded worker failures.
- **Delegated decisions:** Research may propose narrow grants in the structured
  plan policy, but only explicit human approval makes them usable. A later worker
  may select one exact unused option and provide rationale plus observable
  evidence. The controller binds the durable record to the current plan and
  registered job, includes current-plan decisions in successor context and
  execution hashes, and clears old gate evidence before resuming the same stage.
  Requirement-scoped grants apply only when the registered task covers every
  listed requirement. A missing grant or hard-requirement conflict follows the
  amendment path; decisions never approve a plan or change permissions.
- **Capability prerequisites:** a `capability_gap` remains a maintainer wait,
  not a baseline defect, even when paths are protected. Task-local gaps may let
  unrelated dependency-ready work continue. After supplying the prerequisite,
  the affected work must be amended or revised; while the maintainer
  prerequisite remains unresolved, amendment approval requires a writer. The
  controller does not retry automatically or dispatch maintenance for the gap.
- **Amendments:** automatically proposed for eligible approval conflicts, never
  automatically approved. A prior approved plan is required. Automatic proposals
  start only when the lifecycle is blocked, no amendment is pending, and the
  current default-branch head still matches the trusted revision. Human commands
  bind exact source, baseline, request,
  plan and workflow. Stale proposals can be replaced with higher versions.
  Three-way integration preserves disjoint work; actual overlapping application
  files need exact maintainer-approved blob-bound resolutions. Protected files
  and baseline tests are outside the resolution path. All final gates rerun.
- **Baseline maintenance:** a proposal-only role prepares exact diagnosed file
  replacements. The controller persists a writer's explicit patch-hash command
  before creating a separate draft PR. A lost response is retried idempotently.
  Neither feature source nor main is automatically changed by the proposal.
  After normal review and merge, an already approved feature may use a scoped
  amendment. Before approval, or when starting over is intended, use full revision.
- **Manual controls:** requester or writer may pause, revise, or cancel.
  Only a writer may resume or retry. Scoped amendments additionally support
  source-preserving decisions. Retry clears infrastructure failures, not global
  budgets, and rejects unresolved structured decisions or exhausted recoveries.
- **Late output:** interruption retains any unsettled cost identity and clears
  the active job in one state write before requesting worker cancellation.
  Late costs can be collected; late results cannot authorize their own acceptance.
- **Partial publication:** if a commit was written before interruption, recovery
  verifies its parent, proposal digest, and complete expected file tree. A
  matching commit message alone is insufficient.
- **State races:** updates include the prior state-file SHA. Conflicting writes
  fail instead of silently overwriting another checkpoint. A future controller
  run reloads state; GitHub API calls and state writes are not one transaction.
- **Attempt diagnostics:** failed workflows and telemetry warnings produce a
  comment keyed by job and run before their cost is checkpointed. A failed
  Security result is validated for identity and read-only changes before its
  bounded summary is displayed as untrusted progress. Neither that summary nor
  its claimed outcome is used to accept failed work. Comment retries are
  idempotent, and a failed comment write leaves the cost unrecorded for retry.

The schedule reconciles every 10 minutes and can recover established lifecycles
after events are coalesced by Actions concurrency. Initial lifecycle creation
still requires a live authorized label event. Manual dispatch can reconcile one
issue or all known lifecycles. Turning `SDLC_ENABLED` off prevents new starts and transitions, but
already-running jobs must also be cancelled for an immediate emergency stop.

Once `pr_open` is reached, normal PR review owns further interaction. The
controller observes merge or closure; it does not autonomously respond to PR
review comments or rerun the lifecycle for subsequent PR pushes. Pending cost
collection and the issue's cost status can still progress, including after merge.

## State and Evidence

### Domain Records

| Record | Meaning and relationship |
| --- | --- |
| Epic | Original request and human discussion; owns one lifecycle |
| Plan | Versioned proposed scope; implementation needs its approval |
| Approval | Human actor and comment bound to an exact plan hash |
| Delegated decision | Exact approved grant option, rationale, evidence, and registered job identity; active only under its plan hash |
| Task | Bounded work item in the approved plan's dependency graph |
| Job | One registered attempt to execute a stage against a commit |
| Recovery | Verified blocker, stage/task/step fingerprint, bounded attempts, optional unaccepted draft or maintainer proposal |
| Amendment | Retained source and tasks, nominated baseline, exact proposed permissions, required human decision |
| Dependency patch | Original and patched hashes bound to the current approved plan and accepted publication |
| Pending cost | Original job identity, fixed expiry, and optional observed measurements; not execution authority |
| Usage history | Settled job/persona attribution, observed model/token metadata, and any recorded accepted-result commit; not gate evidence |
| Evidence | Accepted stage summary and run reference for one commit |
| Feature PR | Published integrated feature, awaiting normal human review |

State is stored as `issues/<number>.json` on the protected `sdlc-state` branch.
A lifecycle for a registered foreign target is stored as
`targets/<repository-id>/issues/<number>.json` and records its target binding; the
adapter rejects a record loaded from, saved to, or dispatched under another target's
path. That branch is initialized with an isolated root commit, separate from feature
history. The default feature branch pattern is `agentic/epic-<number>-v<version>`;
the branch is created lazily when an accepted text change or an approved
amendment integration is published.

### Schema Migration

New records and all writes use `schemaVersion: 2`. The shared loader validates
either version 2 or the known version-1 formats, which may have no `spend` object
or an existing cost ledger. `migrateLifecycle` converts version 1 in memory and
does not change phase, plan text or hash, approval, tasks, evidence, job identity,
commit bindings, or existing cost counters. Malformed data and unknown versions
are rejected; current-version writes never apply implicit defaults.

`pendingCosts` is an optional version-2 extension, bounded to 100 entries by
the maximum supported lifecycle job budget. Records without it remain valid
without resets or a migration write. Entries reject unexpected authority fields
and duplicate job IDs, and the field is removed when the queue empties. Older
strict version-2 readers do not support this extension; rollback must preserve it.

Optional `models` arrays extend cost receipts, pending observations, and `spend`.
They hold bounded concrete model IDs, with up to 20 IDs captured per run and
2,000 accumulated across the maximum 100 jobs. Legacy records load without them
and are not backfilled. Older strict readers reject these fields too, so the
controller and compiled workflow must be deployed together after draining old
runs, and rollback must retain model-field support. Model availability is not a
new migration or acceptance condition.

Optional `usageHistory` retains up to 100 unique registered jobs and rejects
duplicate known run IDs or mismatched stage/persona pairs. Retained identities
can also include the task and dispatch-attempt counter. Optional receipt fields
`requestedModel` and `tokenUsage` preserve selector and token observations.
Pending and settled records may include controller-accepted result metadata.
Existing records without these fields load unchanged; no history is inferred
from aggregate totals. Deployment and rollback must retain the upgraded readers.

Recovery extends version 2 with optional blocker/draft history, backoff,
amendments, bounded delegated decisions and a monotonic `planVersion`, preflight state, dependency selections and patches,
maintenance publication intent, task steps, and execution hashes. No permission
is backfilled from legacy plan prose. New phases and stages require the upgraded
controller, profiles and workflows together. Recovery history and draft payloads
are bounded, and state writes over 1 MB are rejected before publication.

The storage adapter returns a transient `needsMigration` flag alongside the
original file SHA. Only the controller saves the upgrade, before any command,
PR processing, or terminal-state early return. This includes `pr_open`, `merged`,
and `cancelled` records. Workers use the same read-only loader and cannot persist
an upgrade. Migration is idempotent: an uncommitted write can be retried, a lost
acknowledgement is resolved by reloading, and stale writers fail the existing
SHA concurrency check. The flag is not stored in the lifecycle JSON.

The migration does not authorize new work or relax trusted-revision checks.
Deploy only after older controller and worker runs are idle, following
[State Upgrades](operations.md#state-upgrades).

### Revision Bindings

| Binding | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `baseSha` | Baseline source and tests for this plan's implementation |
| `controlSha` | Trusted workflow and automation revision |
| `headSha` | Latest controller-accepted feature commit |
| `plan.hash` | Immutable plan content and version fingerprint |
| `plan.policy` | Hashed requirements, dependency pins, bounded repair flexibility and optional exact conflict resolutions |
| `job.inputSha` | Source commit supplied to a particular worker |
| `job.executionHash` and `job.stepId` | Bind an exact task breakdown and optional registered split step |
| `job.probeSha` | Separate immutable baseline used by a registered preflight scan |
| `job.runId` | Accepted GitHub run for the registered job |
| `spend` | Cumulative recorded runner time and AI credits |
| `spend.models` | Optional distinct concrete model IDs observed in settled primary-agent receipts; informational, not a complete model history |
| `spend.historyComplete` | `false` when historical or finalized cost telemetry is unavailable |
| `pendingCosts` | Unsettled original job identities, fixed collection deadlines, and optional observed values excluded from totals |
| `usageHistory` | Durable per-job stage/persona, model and token observations, original bindings, and any accepted outcome/output commit |

At initialization, approval, and replanning, baseline and controller SHAs are
captured from the default branch. `baseSha` then remains fixed while the
candidate head advances. An approved amendment updates `baseSha` only after its
integration succeeds. Dispatch inputs carry the issue, job, stage, candidate SHA,
and controller SHA.

`controlSha` tracks the default branch rather than pinning one commit for the
whole lifecycle, because `workflow_dispatch` always runs at the head: a pin left
behind by unrelated commits would fail every worker's revision gate and stall the
lifecycle silently. Between registered jobs the controller compares its pinned
revision with the current head and adopts the head when no protected path
differs. A protected-path difference means the trusted harness itself moved, so
the lifecycle stops for a full revision or a maintainer-requested scoped amendment.
Anything the comparison cannot judge cleanly, such as a revert, a force push, or
a diff at the API's file cap, is treated as a protected-path change.

Intake-only control files are the exception: the target registry
(`.github/sdlc/targets.json`), the receipt workflow
(`.github/workflows/sdlc-intake-receipt.yml`), and the caller templates under
`.github/sdlc/templates/` govern how new requests are received, not how a running
lifecycle executes. A change limited to them does not stop running lifecycles,
except that a registry change which alters a foreign target's own ID, repository,
or enabled flag stops that target's lifecycles. Any other protected path in the
same comparison still stops them.

For a foreign target, `baseSha`, `headSha`, the base branch, and an amendment's
`targetSha` describe the target repository, while `controlSha` is always a
control-repository revision. Trusted-path comparisons use only control revisions,
and target default-branch movement is handled as baseline drift by approval,
amendment, and maintenance checks. A target job's source manifest binds the
target repository ID and name, issue, job, `controlSha`, the `source`, `base`,
and `scan` commits, the bundle digest, and the baseline test paths. Each consumer
rejects a manifest that differs from its own registered job, so a bundle cannot
be replayed into another job or target.

Trusted-revision detection uses `isProtectedPath`: the protected patterns in
[policy.json](../.github/sdlc/policy.json) plus the hardcoded automation and
agent-instruction exclusions in [changes.ts](../src/changes.ts). This is not the
complete set of agent edit restrictions. Tests present at `baseSha` are separately
immutable to all feature workers, even when their paths are not protected. A
default-branch change confined to such a test is not itself protected-path drift;
adopting its workflow revision does not update `baseSha` or incorporate that edit
into the feature. A full revision or approved amendment is needed to change the
feature's baseline. The persisted job links these inputs to the plan and task.

### Publication Preconditions

Before creating the final PR, the controller requires:

1. An intact plan whose hash matches the recorded human approval.
2. Phase `publishing`, no active job, and at least one task.
3. Every task marked implemented and a head commit different from the baseline.
4. Accepted `scan`, `security`, `test`, `validate`, `document`, and `review` evidence on the
   exact candidate head SHA.
5. No unresolved recovery, amendment, preflight or dependency-only repair.
6. The working branch still pointing to that reviewed commit.

Publication creates or reuses the feature PR, posts the reviewer's report as an
advisory `COMMENT`, and publishes `SDLC / Complete` on the reviewed SHA. The App
does not approve or merge the PR. Configured branch rules, normal CI, and human
review govern merging. Selecting the App as the required check's expected
source is an installation step, not something these workflows configure.

### Cost Accounting

Complete worker costs are charged exactly once to `spend`. The active job's
`costedRun` marker and the tally are saved together; deferred settlement removes
its pending entry in the same SHA-checked write as the tally update. Reloading
after a failed write or lost acknowledgement cannot double count. This includes
rejected and failed results, cancelled workers, and superseded plans. Unlike
evidence, costs survive a change of head commit or plan.

The same settlement write appends a `usageHistory` entry with a copied original
job identity and its assigned persona, derived by the controller rather than
the receipt. Repeated settlement of the same identity is a no-op; conflicting
identities or duplicated known run IDs are rejected. Missing observations are
omitted, never synthesized from current settings. Jobs that were never
discovered retain identity without a fabricated run ID or charge. The history
survives pending cleanup, replanning, source changes, and artifact expiry.

Normal result acceptance separately annotates its pending or settled usage with
`acceptedResult` (outcome and resulting commit). Rejected or stale results and
failed agent workflows are not annotated. Accounting never reads an abandoned
result to fill this field, and historical accepted results never replace
current-commit gate evidence. No routing or diversity policy consumes the ledger.

Before clearing a dispatched, uncosted job, interruption and replanning retain
its ID, stage, original source and trusted revision, plan hash, creation time,
and any discovered run ID in `pendingCosts`. Incomplete receipts also retain
their observed values there even when the stage advances. Pending observations
are not yet included in totals. Repeated observations preserve known values,
use the largest observed runner duration rather than summing repeated reads,
and retain an observed credit-limit snapshot and concrete model IDs when later
reads omit them. Model IDs are deduplicated and sorted, not counted as new runs.
The first observed requested selector is retained. Token observations use a
single best snapshot, preferring available over partial and then more requests;
retries never add snapshots together or erase a better one with missing data.

Every reconciliation processes abandoned accounting before terminal-state
returns, matching the original workflow, actor, revision, job, and first run
attempt. It never reads a historical result or mutates approval or evidence.
Abandoned running workers receive renewed cancellation requests. Transient
lookup, cancellation, and receipt failures do not block unrelated stage progress.
The fixed collection window is `jobTimeoutMinutes` from first deferral (90
minutes by default), not a deadline refreshed by each poll. If data is still
missing after that window or retrieval fails permanently, an idempotent
accounting diagnostic identifies the job; only observed values are settled and
history is marked incomplete. Nothing is invented for an undiscovered run.

The current active job keeps the existing bounded error path: thrown permanent
or expired retrieval errors consume one worker failure without accepting the
result. Any previously observed pending values are settled once, its entry is
removed, and history is marked incomplete. Deferred-only failures do not fail a
newer job. Missing telemetry itself remains observational, not a new gate.

At PR creation, the publisher includes the controller's configured `SDLC_MODEL`
and resolved `SDLC_AIC_CREDIT_LIMIT` in the Cost section, with defaults of `auto`
and `250`. These are a publication-time configuration snapshot, not per-run
history or a resolved inference-model identity. The cap applies separately to
each inference job, not each turn. Existing PR descriptions are left unchanged
on publication retries, even if repository variables or settled costs have
since changed. Totals are also labeled as a creation-time snapshot, with pending
jobs explicitly excluded and a link to the issue's updating lifecycle status.
Pending accounting does not delay an otherwise eligible publication.

The Cost section also lists **Observed agent models**, independently of the
configuration snapshot. The post-step reads concrete `model` IDs from the
primary agent's structured `token-usage.jsonl`, rather than from agent prose or
the configured selector. Missing/unreadable logs, malformed records, oversized
files, `auto`, and `unknown` cannot invent a concrete model. Logs are opened as
regular non-symlink files, limited to 5 MB, and model IDs are restricted to bounded
display-safe text. No usable IDs means `unavailable`. These runtime observations
are diagnostic metadata, not attestation, acceptance evidence, or billing truth.
They do not alter credit calculations, retry deadlines, or gates. Model history
is not backfilled, and absence does not change `spend.historyComplete`.

The post-step also captures the workflow's configured selector in
`requestedModel` and per-model request/input/output/cache-read/cache-write
counts in `tokenUsage`, without changing AI-credit calculations. Repeated
nonempty request IDs are counted once. Malformed records, missing/invalid
counts, or the 20-model cap make telemetry partial; a missing count is `null`,
not measured zero. No concrete models means unavailable telemetry. Counters
preserve the runtime's cache semantics, which can overlap with input counts;
they are not normalized across labs or translated into per-model billing.
The 10 KB receipt limit remains unchanged. Token availability is not a new
stage gate or a reason to extend collection deadlines.

Model lists cover available settled primary-agent receipts, not all inference:
legacy/missing telemetry and the separate threat detector are not covered.
Several models may appear, including with automatic selection. The PR model
list is also fixed at creation; issue status reflects later settlements. Displays
show at most 20 IDs plus a remaining count, without dropping the accumulated
set from state. This is
not a per-model cost breakdown or a guarantee of model diversity across reviews.

New lifecycles and migrated version-1 cost ledgers have
`spend.historyComplete: true`. A version-1 record without `spend` starts with
zero recorded-run counters and `historyComplete: false`: earlier costs are
unknown, not zero. Issue status and newly created PR descriptions qualify those
totals as partial history. The flag remains false through subsequent charging,
repairs, and replanning; no historical backfill or existing PR rewrite occurs.
Existing `job.costedRun` receipts are preserved to prevent charging a completed
run again after migration. Job identities discarded by older controllers and
unknown receipts already marked costed cannot be safely reconstructed from the
aggregate tally. This update does not certify or backfill that earlier history.

Runner time is the sum of each job's start-to-finish duration. GitHub reports
zero billable time for public repositories, so billable minutes cannot be used.

Credits and the pre-emption flag come from a `sdlc-cost` artifact written by a
workflow post-step, not by the agent, so an agent cannot understate its own cost.
The post-step reads the compiler's `parse-mcp-gateway` outputs, where
`ai_credits_rate_limit_error` records that the firewall proxy refused a further
inference. That distinguishes a run that finished near the cap from one the
limiter actually interrupted, whose result may be incomplete. Because the cap is
applied between inferences rather than mid-request, a pre-empted run can finish
slightly above it. A true pre-emption flag confirms the compiler detected the
limit, but a false flag does not rule out a budget refusal reported instead as an
authentication error. Inspect the archived proxy usage and error records when a
worker returns HTTP 403 after successful inference near the cap; neither that
status code nor the credit total alone establishes the cause.

The runtime policy resolves `maxJobCredits` from `SDLC_AIC_CREDIT_LIMIT`, with
the checked-in policy providing the default of `250`. New cost artifacts also
include the `creditLimit` captured by the workflow's budget job. A run is
classified as near-limit at 80% of its recorded cap, unless it was pre-empted.
If an older artifact lacks this field, the controller falls back to its current
resolved limit. Changing the repository variable does not retroactively change
stored counters, and status separates near-limit counts from the current cap.
The artifact format remains backward-compatible; no lifecycle migration is
required. The custom cost artifact still measures primary-agent inference only.

Cost receipts represent unavailable usage and stop signals with `null` rather
than numeric zero or boolean false. Missing, expired, duplicate, or oversized
agent receipts produce unknown telemetry; malformed receipt content is still
rejected. Deterministic scan, validation and integration jobs have known zero inference
usage. Unknown credits or stop signals remain pending until recovery or expiry.
Unrecoverable telemetry sets `historyComplete` false; later successful settlement
never clears an existing incomplete-history flag. Only measured credits with
`preempted: false` contribute to the near-limit
counter, and only `true` contributes to the pre-emption counter.

For a failed workflow or unknown/pre-empted telemetry, the controller publishes
per-attempt diagnostics with the registered stage, job, commits, plan, run link,
cap, measured duration, and available usage/stop signals. Failed Security
checkpoints are displayed only after normal result-identity and change-policy
validation and are never accepted as evidence. Telemetry remains observational:
a successful run with a valid `pass` is not rejected solely for pre-emption.
A controlled, authorized live signal test is required before introducing such
a gate; being near the cap alone must not invalidate a completed review.

Limits come from [policy](../.github/sdlc/policy.json), the workflow sources,
[receipts.ts](../src/receipts.ts), [targets.ts](../src/targets.ts), [source.ts](../src/source.ts),
and the validated `SDLC_AIC_CREDIT_LIMIT` repository-variable override.
State history and issue/PR summaries retain evidence links, not perpetual copies
of expired artifacts. The usage ledger retains captured accounting fields, not
raw prompts, responses, or token logs. Actions minutes and aggregate inference usage need
separate billing controls.

## Cross-Repository Intake

A registered target repository holds no controller credentials. Its only SDLC
file is `.github/workflows/sdlc-intake.yml`, rendered from
[the caller template](../.github/sdlc/templates/sdlc-intake.yml). On an
`issues: labeled` event for the intake label, that caller runs the
[receipt workflow](../.github/workflows/sdlc-intake-receipt.yml) from this
repository, pinned to a full commit SHA. The receipt job has no permissions and
no secrets: it copies an allowlisted snapshot of the event (action, label,
repository ID, issue number, title, body, author, and sender) into a short-lived
`sdlc-intake` artifact. Comments in the target are never trusted on their own;
the controller reads them later through a target-scoped token.

The controller does not trust the artifact because it exists. A target writer can
edit the caller, re-run a run, or upload artifacts from another workflow, so a
receipt is accepted only when every check below holds:

- The run belongs to the target's `sdlc-intake.yml`, is an `issues` event in the
  registered repository ID, is first attempt, completed successfully, and was
  created after the target's `activatedAt` and within the last 24 hours.
- The run's actor equals its triggering actor, and its only referenced workflow is
  the receipt workflow at the registered `receiptRef` from this control repository.
- The caller file at the run's commit is byte-identical, after line-ending
  normalization, to the template rendered with this repository, `receiptRef`, and
  the policy label.
- `receiptRef` is an ancestor of, or equal to, the control default branch. A
  commit reachable only through a fork network cannot be registered as the pin.
- Exactly one unexpired `sdlc-intake` artifact exists, within the size limit, and
  its strict snapshot names this repository ID, a `labeled` action, the exact
  policy label, and a `User` sender equal to the run actor.

An accepted receipt is only an intake request. It passes through the same
`tick` as a local label: the controller rereads the target issue, and starts a
lifecycle only when the issue is open, still labeled, authored by the snapshot's
requester, and the sender currently has write access to the target.

      end
    end
  CriControl->>CriState: Record decided runs by compare-and-swap
```

The cursor at `targets/<repository-id>/intake.json` on the state branch records the
scan window start and the run IDs already decided in it. A lifecycle is created
before its run is recorded, so an interruption repeats an idempotent tick instead
of losing intake. Rejected runs are recorded and never revisited. Incomplete runs,
receipts whose artifact is not visible yet, inspection-budget overflow, and failed
ticks hold the window open for the next reconciliation. A run that never yields
an artifact is rejected 15 minutes after it last updated.

Receipts are polled whenever the controller reconciles without a selected issue:
the 10-minute schedule and manual runs that leave the issue empty. Target events
do not reach this repository, so comment commands on target issues are read on
the same cadence. A controller outage longer than the 24-hour lookback
drops unscanned receipts; reapply the label after recovery. The runs listing
returns at most 1,000 runs per window, so a burst larger than that can be missed.

For each enabled target, the controller signs an App JWT with the private key,
finds the App installation on that repository, and requests an installation token
restricted to the target's repository ID with Actions read and Checks, Contents,
Issues, and Pull requests write. The token is refused unless GitHub returns
exactly that repository and those permissions, plus Metadata. Administration is
never requested. One target's failure is logged and does not stop the others.

### Target Execution

A target lifecycle uses the same stages, workers, and acceptance rules as a local
one. Only source handoff and publication scope differ. The controller dispatches
the agent and check workflows here with the target's repository ID, owner, and
name. Each first calls the [source workflow](../.github/workflows/sdlc-source.yml),
whose single job runs in the `sdlc-reader` environment with `contents: read` on
this repository. It runs only from the default branch, as the controller App,
at the dispatched control revision, and only for target jobs. Its pinned token
action mints a Reader App token for that one target with Contents read.

```

The source job installs this repository's dependencies with lifecycle scripts
disabled and runs only the worker's `source` operation. Git runs with no global
or system configuration, hooks, submodules, LFS smudging, or credential helper;
the token travels as a per-URL header in the environment, never in arguments.
Objects are checked during the fetch, and nothing is checked out. A repository
over the 256 MiB limit fails instead of falling back to a shallow history.

Consumers verify the manifest against their own registered job and the bundle
against its size and SHA-256 digest, then restore the commit they need into
`source/` or `baseline/`. The restored repository's `origin` is the local bundle.
gh-aw always checks out `source/` for the agent job, so a target agent run checks
out the control revision first and the restore replaces it before preparation.
gh-aw's credential setup then re-points `origin` at this repository, so a
pre-agent step restores the bundle URL before the agent starts.

Accepted results are published exactly as for a local issue, but through the
per-target installation token: feature commits, the final PR, the advisory
review, and `SDLC / Complete` land in the target, while state stays here under
`targets/<repository-id>/`. A failed or refused source job fails its workflow,
which counts under the normal [Recovery Flow](#recovery-flow). Reconciliation
also skips a target that fails the identity or exposure check, before reading
its receipts, issues, or state.

## Trust Boundaries and Scope

The controller's App key belongs only to the `sdlc-controller` environment.
While any registered target is enabled, the controller's Node step also receives
the key to mint per-target installation tokens; otherwise only the pinned token
action reads it. No receipt, source, target, or worker workflow receives it.
The Reader App key belongs only to `sdlc-reader`, where only the source job's
pinned token action reads it. That job never checks out or executes target code,
and target source reaches candidate jobs only as a digest-bound bundle artifact.
Agent inference credentials belong to `sdlc-agent`; they do not grant the
controller's repository publishing authority. The CodeQL job has scoped
`security-events: write`, but no App token and no candidate build.
Candidate tests run in separate jobs without either App credential.

Anyone who can read this repository can read target content mirrored here,
including issue text, plans, logs, bundles, and other artifacts. The controller
refuses a target whose identity drifted or whose visibility is wider than this
repository's. Visibility does not prove that the two audiences match, so each
target needs an access review per trust domain; see
[Exposure and Trust Domains](operations.md#exposure-and-trust-domains). Target
CI can run controller-published branches with the target's own credentials; see
[Target CI](operations.md#target-ci).

File policy is enforced outside the model: only coding, testing, and documentation
may return feature edits in `report.changes`. Testing is limited to
`policy.testPaths`; documentation is limited to `policy.docsPaths`. Protected automation paths,
baseline tests, unsafe paths, case-colliding path segments, symlinks, binary
data, oversized changes, and conflicting branch history are rejected. Maintenance
uses the separate `maintenanceChanges` proposal field, not feature-edit authority;
its draft PR requires an explicit writer command. Worker role instructions provide
behavioral guidance; merely reading a role profile does not create a separate
operating-system permission boundary between roles.

Compiler-generated agent post-processing has no issue, content, pull-request,
check, deployment, package, or security-event write permission. Its isolated
`actions: write` grant is used only by pinned framework code for the daily
AI-credit cache; agent-selected safe outputs cannot use it for repository
mutation. Plan and evidence Markdown is treated as untrusted and issue-closing
keywords are neutralized before the controller builds the final PR.

The current prototype does not implement parallel coding integration, automatic
rebasing, deployment, automatic merging, or a Projects dashboard. Targets share
this repository's policy and Node.js/npm check stack. Receipt artifacts are
readable by anyone who can read the target's Actions runs, and the receipt
workflow must be accessible to each target. Cross-repository execution, the
public-preview agent runtime, and all live permissions still need a bounded pilot. Local fixtures and tests validate controller behavior;
they cannot guarantee model correctness or prove service-side configuration.
